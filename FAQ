This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about OneTuple, the
optional Haskell singleton tuple type.

Some of these are, of course, merely anticipated FAQs.

Q 1.  What's the point, if you can't support the same syntax as
      'normal' tuples?
A 1.  You can hack it up in TH if you want -- patches are welcome!
      Simplicity and (near) H98 compatibility were goals in building
      OneTuple.

Q 2.  Why define 'data OneTuple' instead of just a type alias?
A 2.  For laziness and pattern matching similar to other tuples.

Q 3.  Isn't this the same as <something> ?
A 3.  Could be, but this one's sold as a tuple!

Q 4.  Singleton tuples don't make sense!  They're isomorphic to their
      component type!
A 4.  Yes, that's true, up to laziness.
